/**
 * Compose a series of functions from right to left.
 *
 * This is the functional equivalent of `f(g(h(x)))`, allowing you to write
 * pipelines of transformations that apply in reverse order. It is often
 * used when the final result should be applied to a value later (as in
 * `compose(f, g, h)(value)`), or when writing point-free functional code.
 *
 * Composition is lazy â€” it returns a new function that can be applied to a value.
 * This is especially useful for defining reusable data transformation pipelines.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const trim = (s: string) => s.trim();
 * const toUpper = (s: string) => s.toUpperCase();
 * const exclaim = (s: string) => `${s}!`;
 *
 * const shout = compose(exclaim, toUpper, trim);
 * const result = shout("  hello  ");
 * // result: "HELLO!"
 * ```
 *
 * @template R The final return type after all functions have been composed
 * @param fns A variadic list of functions where each output is compatible with the next input
 * @returns A function that applies the composed transformations right-to-left
